                      ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
[..]
The DMA Extension HAL driver can be used as follows:

 (+) Configure the DMA_MUX Synchronization Block using HAL_DMAEx_ConfigMuxSync function.
 (+) Configure the DMA_MUX Request Generator Block using HAL_DMAEx_ConfigMuxRequestGenerator function.
     Functions HAL_DMAEx_EnableMuxRequestGenerator and HAL_DMAEx_DisableMuxRequestGenerator can then be used
     to respectively enable/disable the request generator.

 (+) To handle the DMAMUX Interrupts, the function  HAL_DMAEx_MUX_IRQHandler should be called from
     the DMAMUX IRQ handler i.e DMAMUX1_OVR_IRQHandler.
     As only one interrupt line is available for all DMAMUX channels and request generators , HAL_DMAEx_MUX_IRQHandler should be
     called with, as parameter, the appropriate DMA handle as many as used DMAs in the user project
    (exception done if a given DMA is not using the DMAMUX SYNC block neither a request generator)\end{DoxyVerb}
