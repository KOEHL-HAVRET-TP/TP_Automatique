                  ##### GPIO Peripheral features #####
==============================================================================
[..]
  (+) Each port bit of the general-purpose I/O (GPIO) ports can be individually
      configured by software in several modes:
      (++) Input mode
      (++) Analog mode
      (++) Output mode
      (++) Alternate function mode
      (++) External interrupt/event lines

  (+) During and just after reset, the alternate functions and external interrupt
      lines are not active and the I/O ports are configured in input floating mode.

  (+) All GPIO pins have weak internal pull-up and pull-down resistors, which can be
      activated or not.

  (+) In Output or Alternate mode, each IO can be configured on open-drain or push-pull
      type and the IO speed can be selected depending on the VDD value.

  (+) The microcontroller IO pins are connected to onboard peripherals/modules through a
      multiplexer that allows only one peripheral alternate function (AF) connected
     to an IO pin at a time. In this way, there can be no conflict between peripherals
     sharing the same IO pin.

  (+) All ports have external interrupt/event capability. To use external interrupt
      lines, the port must be configured in input mode. All available GPIO pins are
      connected to the 16 external interrupt/event lines from EXTI0 to EXTI15.

  (+) The external interrupt/event controller consists of up to 44 edge detectors
      (16 lines are connected to GPIO) for generating event/interrupt requests (each
      input line can be independently configured to select the type (interrupt or event)
      and the corresponding trigger event (rising or falling or both). Each line can
      also be masked independently.

                   ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
[..]
  (#) Enable the GPIO AHB clock using the following function: __HAL_RCC_GPIOx_CLK_ENABLE().

  (#) Configure the GPIO pin(s) using HAL_GPIO_Init().
      (++) Configure the IO mode using "Mode" member from GPIO_InitTypeDef structure
      (++) Activate Pull-up, Pull-down resistor using "Pull" member from GPIO_InitTypeDef
           structure.
      (++) In case of Output or alternate function mode selection: the speed is
           configured through "Speed" member from GPIO_InitTypeDef structure.
      (++) In alternate mode is selection, the alternate function connected to the IO
           is configured through "Alternate" member from GPIO_InitTypeDef structure.
      (++) Analog mode is required when a pin is to be used as ADC channel
           or DAC output.
      (++) In case of external interrupt/event selection the "Mode" member from
           GPIO_InitTypeDef structure select the type (interrupt or event) and
           the corresponding trigger event (rising or falling or both).

  (#) In case of external interrupt/event mode selection, configure NVIC IRQ priority
      mapped to the EXTI line using HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() and enable it using
      HAL_NVIC_EnableIRQ().

  (#) To get the level of a pin configured in input mode use HAL_GPIO_ReadPin().

  (#) To set/reset the level of a pin configured in output mode use
      HAL_GPIO_WritePin()/HAL_GPIO_TogglePin().

 (#) To lock pin configuration until next reset use HAL_GPIO_LockPin().

  (#) During and just after reset, the alternate functions are not
      active and the GPIO pins are configured in input floating mode (except JTAG
      pins).

  (#) The LSE oscillator pins OSC32_IN and OSC32_OUT can be used as general purpose
      (PC14 and PC15, respectively) when the LSE oscillator is off. The LSE has
      priority over the GPIO function.

  (#) The HSE oscillator pins OSC_IN/OSC_OUT can be used as
      general purpose PF0 and PF1, respectively, when the HSE oscillator is off.
      The HSE has priority over the GPIO function.\end{DoxyVerb}
